            <h2>About Little Mix</h2>
            <p><strong>Little Mix</strong> is a British girl band that was formed in 2011. 
                It is the leading girl band worlwide with the best songs ever. 
                Their songs are a mix of <em>pop and R&B</em>. They also combine other genres like <span>latin pop</span>. Over the years, they have won quite amazing awards and prizes owing to their hardwork.<br>
                
                Who wouldn't love to listen to songs that are actual masterpieces? They are the most charismatic group I know. Another thing, I also admire their zeal, passion, and tenacity to be able to handle challenges in the music industry. <span>I love Little Mix</span>
